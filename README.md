## Hi there

I'm Pierre, French, living in the beautiful Netherlands

People are lost in History because dates are too abstract.
That's why I build wikitime.org (interactive timelines) and histopen.org (History database).
Some day, I'll tell how the idea came up.

I learnt html, css and js for that purpose.
Tech stack: ts, react, vite, pixi, three, gsap.
Special thanks to Copilot.
